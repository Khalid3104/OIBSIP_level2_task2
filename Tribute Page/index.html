        Rohit is an Indian Cricketer and a right-handed opening batsman and bowls right-arm off break occasionally. Rohit is widely popular for his aggressive style of batting where he likes to take the charge to the bowler. He is the only batsman in the world to hit three double centuries in ODI cricket. He also holds the record for most number of runs scored by a batsman in a single innings of ODI cricket (264 vs Sri Lanka). Because of his aggressive batting style, Rohit has been nicknamed 'Hitman'.
